If you are new to Open Source, Git, and GitHub, this guide is for you. This guide contains resources and materials to learn and get yourself started with Open Source, Git, and GitHub. 

## What is Open Source?

Open Source refers to a software or project that is publicly accessible and allows anyone to inspect, modify, and distribute the source code. Open Source projects encourage collaboration and sharing of knowledge among developers and the community.

## What is Version Control and Git?

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Git is a distributed version control system that allows you to track changes in your codebase, collaborate with other developers, and manage your project effectively. Git is most popularly used with code hosting platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

## What is GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket?

GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket are code hosting platforms that provide a collaborative environment for developers to work on projects, share code, and collaborate with other developers. These platforms offer features like issue tracking, pull requests, code reviews, and project management tools to help developers work together effectively. GitHub is the most popular platform among developers and is widely used in the Open Source community.
