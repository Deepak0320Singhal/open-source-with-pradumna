### What are the prerequisites for stepping into Open Source?

You need to have a basic understanding of git (Version control system) and a code hosting platform like GitHub.

### Is Open Source only for beginners?

Yes, Open Source is for everyone. It doesn't matter if you are a beginner or an expert. You can contribute to Open Source projects depending on your interest, programming language, topics, etc.

### Can I contribute to Open Source if I have no prior coding experience or I am from a non-technical background?

Yes, you can contribute to documentation, articles and tutorials, testing/user experience, design, translation, etc.

### Where to learn Git and GitHub?

You can check out resources in [How to?](./how-to/create-repo.md), [Learning Resources](./resources.md), and [Bootcamp](./bootcamp.md) pages for the same.

### How to get started with Open Source?

Steps:

1. Start with learning the basics of **Git** and **GitHub**. You can check out resources in [Resources](./resources.md), [Bootcamp](./bootcamp.md), and [How to?](./how-to/create-repo.md).

2. Once you are familiar with the basics, start contributing to beginner-friendly projects to get familiar with the workflow and terminology of Open Source, Git, and GitHub. You can find some projects on the [Beginner Friendly Projects](./beginners.md) page. Also, contributing to your friend's project is a great way to get started.

3. Do join a community so that you can get help and guidance from the community members if you get stuck somewhere. I will recommend joining EddieHub Community on [Discord](http://discord.eddiehub.org/).

4. Once you are comfortable with the workflow, you can start contributing to Open Source projects depending on your interest, programming language, topics, etc. I will recommend starting with small projects and then moving on to bigger projects. Also, when you start with a project, first try solving and working on issues with the label `good first issue` and `first timers only`. This is a wonderful way to understand a project better and then move on to other issues. Also, I have written a Blog on [5 ways to find projects in Open Source](https://blog.pradumnasaraf.dev/5-ways-to-find-projects-in-open-source) you can check it out.
